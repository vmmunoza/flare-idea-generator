Build a web app called “Flare Idea Generator (FIG)” to help blockchain developers discover innovative dApp ideas that can be built on the Flare Network. The site should be lightweight, fast, and developer-friendly, using only frontend technologies to start (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). It will show a new project idea every time the user clicks a “Generate Idea” button.

Each idea card should include:
- A project title
- A short, clear description
- Relevant Flare features (e.g., FTSO, FDC, FAssets)
- A link to relevant documentation or example

Add 20 different predefined idea entries in a JSON format embedded into the frontend. The ideas must be original, varied, and each clearly demonstrate how to use at least one Flare feature (FDC, FTSO, or FAssets).

Basic layout:
- A dark theme with a bold “Flare Idea Generator” title
- A call-to-action subtitle: “Discover what to build on Flare.”
- One main button: “Generate Idea”
- A card layout below showing the selected idea
- A footer with a link to Flare dev docs

Stack:
- HTML for structure
- CSS for styling (responsive, dark mode)
- JavaScript for logic and dynamic content

Bonus: include a placeholder div to later add a “View Architecture” button in future updates (don’t build the diagram now, just leave the hook in HTML and JS).
